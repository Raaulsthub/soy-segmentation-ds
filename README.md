# Soy and Weed Segmentation Dataset

This dataset comprises 1000 images capturing the progression of a weed invaded soy crop, labeled by human hand for precise instance segmentation. Within these images, you'll find three distinct plant species: Glycine max (soy), Amaranthus viridis (caruru weed), and Cynodon dactylon (grassy weed). These images comprehensively document the  growth cycle of the soy crop, spanning from its initial stages to advanced stages. They showcase various sections of the plantation with varying chemical treatments, ensuring that the growth evolution and weed invasion can be observed in specific areas consistently over time.

Below, you'll find examples of images, labels, and predictions sourced from the dataset. It's crucial to emphasize that the predictive model utilized in this document is Roboflow 3.0 Instance Segmentation (Fast), which differs from the model employed in the paper. Consequently, the predictions attain an inferior level of precision as those reported in the paper.

The first column showcases the actual images, while the second column displays human-crafted labels. In the third column, you'll find predictions generated by the Roboflow 3.0 Fast neural network.
